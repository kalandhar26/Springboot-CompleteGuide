# Introduction to Kafka

## What is Kafka?

Apache Kafka is an **open-source distributed event streaming platform** used for building real-time data pipelines and
streaming applications. It is designed to handle high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable data streams.

### Key Features:

- **Real-time Stream Creation**: Kafka collects and transmits a continuous stream of events from various sources.
- **Real-time Stream Processing**: Kafka allows applications to process and react to data as it arrives.

### Real-World Example – Paytm Payments:

1. When a user books a movie ticket and makes a payment via Paytm, that action becomes an **event**.
2. This event is sent to a **Kafka server**.
3. Since millions of users might be making transactions simultaneously, Kafka handles **millions of events per
   millisecond**.
4. This constant flow of event data from Paytm to Kafka is called **creating a real-time stream**.
5. Once Kafka receives the data, it doesn’t process it directly—instead, **Kafka stores the data**, and **client
   applications** process it.
6. For instance, Paytm might have a rule like **maximum 10 transactions per day per user**.
7. A Kafka **consumer application** can read events, track transaction counts per user, and trigger notifications when
   limits are exceeded.
8. This process of continuously reading and acting on Kafka messages is known as **real-time stream processing**.

## What Does “Distributed” Mean in Microservices?

In the context of microservices, **distributed** means running different parts of an application across **multiple
machines or regions** to improve scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance.

### Kafka as a Distributed System:

Kafka itself is a distributed platform, meaning:

- It can run on **multiple servers (brokers)**.
- Data can be spread across **multiple regions**.
- If one Kafka broker fails, **others can take over**, ensuring no message is lost and minimizing downtime.

This architecture makes Kafka suitable for microservices-based systems, where components need to **communicate
asynchronously** and **scale independently**.

========================

## Why Do We Need Kafka?

Let’s understand with a simple example:

1. Imagine you are expecting a parcel at your home.
2. The postman comes to deliver it, but you’re not at home, so he goes back.
3. He tries again the next day, but you’re still not there.
4. After a few attempts, the postman gives up or returns the parcel to the post office.
5. As a result, you never receive the parcel — and it might contain something very important!

### How Can This Be Solved?

6. You decide to install a **letterbox** outside your home.
7. Now, even if you’re not at home, the postman can drop the parcel in the letterbox.
8. You can collect it later when you return.
9. The letterbox acts as a **middleman** between you and the postman — no more missed deliveries!

## How This Relates to Kafka

Now, let’s replace the people in the story with applications:

- **App1** wants to send messages to **App2**.
- But **App2** might be down or busy and can't receive messages right now.
- **Kafka** acts like the **letterbox** — it holds the messages safely until App2 is ready.
- When App2 is available again, it can read all the messages from Kafka and process them.

### In Simple Terms:

Kafka ensures that no data is lost even if the receiver is temporarily unavailable. It stores the messages and delivers
them when the receiver is ready.


## Why Kafka is Needed in a Microservices Environment

### Problem Scenario
 - Imagine we have 4 applications that want to send different types of data to a database server.
- Right now, everything works fine.

- But in the future, more applications may be added — possibly dozens or even hundreds.
- Managing direct communication between all these applications becomes very complicated and messy
- Challenges You May Face

- 1. **Data Format:** Different applications may use different formats like JSON, XML, etc.
- 2. **Connection Type:** Some use HTTPs, others use TCP, and some may directly use JDBC to talk to the database.
- 3. **Number of Connections:** Every new application adds more connections. As the system grows, managing all of these becomes harder and can impact performance and reliability.

### Solution: Kafka
- This is where Apache Kafka comes into the picture.
- Kafka acts as a centralized messaging system.
- It acts like a middle layer between all your applications.
- Producers (sending apps) send messages to Kafka.
- Consumers (receiving apps) pull messages from Kafka.

- This helps decouple your services and makes your system scalable, flexible, and easier to manage.


# Number of Partitions ≥ Number of Consumers (in a Consumer Group)

- Each partition can be consumed by only one consumer in a consumer group at a time.
- If you have more consumers than partitions, some consumers will be idle (they won’t get any messages).
- If you have equal number, all consumers are actively consuming.
- If you have more partitions than consumers, consumers can be assigned multiple partitions, which is fine and allows better parallelism.
